        <h3>Horsepower: 173bhp</h3>
      
        <p>The Tuono V4 1100 Factory is basically an Aprilia RSV4 fitted with motocross bars and pumped full of midrange. 
         It howls like MotoGP missile and goes like a superbike, 
         but with its upright stance and tourer-like wind protection you don’t have to suffer with crushed wrists and a sore back for your speed.
         Put simply, it’s the best road-going sportsbike money can buy.
         Eye-watering cost aside, there isn’t a single thing you’d want to change. 
         The Tuono ticks every must-have box for the discerning thrill seeker: a brain-fizzing 1077cc, 173bhp V4 motor blessed by the gods
         of grunt and power and an exquisite polished aluminium,
         three-times WSB championship-winning chassis.
         Aprilia’s wonder machine can be calm and relaxed one minute and a speed-crazed psychopath the
          next with its front wheel dangling in mid-air for all eternity.
         Perfect engine, electronics and ergonomics aside, the Tuono V4 1100 Factory is even more impressive in the corners with a supple.

            Ride the Ray of Darkness with the MT-10.
            Driven by a 998cc crossplane engine tuned for extra low to mid-range torque 
            – and rolling on a lightweight ultra-short wheelbase aluminium Deltabox chassis
            with a natural riding position – the MT-10 gives you ultimate power
            with class leading agility and total control.

      <h3>Engina Size: 692.7cc</h3>
      <h3>Horsepower: 55kW</h3>

      <p>If your tastes run more toward canyon carving than dirty adventures,
         the 701 Supermoto is your huckleberry. It features the same potent
         liquid-cooled 693cc single and steel frame with polyamide subframe
         and integrated gas tank, while its adjustable WP suspension
         has a more road-oriented 8.5-/9.8-inch travel front/rear.
         Beefier 4-piston Brembo front and single-piston rear calipers
         bite down on a big 320mm disc up front and a 240mm at the rear.
         Other features like the ride-by-wire, 6-speed transmission,
         hydraulic clutch lever and slipper clutch are also shared
         with the Enduro. However, the Supermoto is fitted with
         17-inch Giant tubeless spoked wheels and sticky 
         Continental ContiAttack Supermoto tires that promise 
         exceptional grip even at the extreme lean angles typical of supermoto riding.</p>
